The FiniteAutomata class expresses a M = (Q,Σ,δ,p,F) finite automata.

The readFromFile(filepath) function reads all elements of the FiniteAutomata form a file in this order:
	- all states (first state is the starting state)
	- all elements of the alphabet
	- all transitions
	- all final states
	
The accepts(sequence) function checks if the given sequence is accepted by the FiniteAutomata:
	- returns false if any unaccepted character exists, if the automata is not deterministic or if the sequence is not accepted
	- returns true otherwise
	
The FA.in file should be like this:
	states = [state","] state
	alphabet = [character","] character
	transitions = [transition","] transition
	transition = state"~"terminal"~"state
	finalstates = [state","] state
	FA = states "\n" alphabet "\n" transitions "\n" finalstates
