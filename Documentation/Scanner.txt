Scanner documentation

The scanner contains a list of operators, separators and reserved keywords.
It also has a Symbol Table and a PIF.

The tokenize() function computes and returns the tokens from the given file by:
	- reading from file and saving the text
	- adding spaces before and after each separator
	- spliting the text by spaces
The scan() function gets the tokens and clasifies them in one of the following categories:
	- reserved words
		- then adds them to PIF
	- operators
		- then adds them to PIF
	- separators
		- then adds them to PIF
	- identifiers
		- then adds them to PIF and the Symbol Table
	- constants
		- then adds them to PIF and the Symbol Table
	- if a token cannot be clasified, print an error
